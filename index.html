                <h2 id="about" class="goto">About</h2>

                <p>
                    My name is Rachael and I am a qualified Reflexologist. I am trained in foot and
                    hand reflexology and was trained by and a part of the International Institute of
                    Reflexology using the original “Ingham Method”, created by our very own Eunice
                    D. Ingham.
                </p>

                <img
                    src="./img/rachael.jpg"
                    class="about--image clearfix"
                    alt="A picture of Rachael, reflexologist"
                />

                <p>
                    I first found reflexology after travelling through Asia. I went there to try to
                    find answers to my problems - I had been through a lot of heart ache and I
                    needed to see if there was any point in life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my time in Asia I started understanding the art of energy work and
                    eventually started to really feel a connection with my surroundings. Something
                    inside me wanted to do more for others - to give back in some way - any way I
                    could help others get through hard times, as I have. I knew using this new found
                    love for energy work had a part to play.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When returning from my amazing adventure I wasn't sure what path to take. I
                    enjoyed massage and researched different massage methods however I was also very
                    interested in the traditional Chinese methods. So after some research I
                    discovered Reflexology. The bright colours on the foot and hand charts and the
                    clever way the whole body was mapped out of the feet and hands intrigued me. I
                    <i>had</i> to know more!
                </p>

                <p>
                    After a long year of hard work, dedication and a few tears, I got my
                    qualification! And thanks to my course I became focused and ready to pass on the
                    knowledge and the skill of reflexology. I feel everyone should try it! Helping
                    others to feel happier and more positive is very special and rewarding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I aim to take Reflexology to as many places as possible. I aim to do and have
                    done: Coffee mornings, one-to-one treatments, retreats, festivals, hen and stag
                    do's... and anywhere the client and I feel will be beneficial for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will bring my energy and love of Reflexology to your life. I am here to help.
                    Thank you for visiting my website, I hope we cross paths sometime soon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Love, Peace & Happiness,
                </p>

                <h3>What is Reflexology?</h3>

                <p>
                    The basis of Reflexology has been recorded throughout history, going as far back
                    as the time of the ancient Egyptians. The practise was passed through many
                    doctors and was finally developed by the late, great Eunice Ingham. With the
                    support of Dr. Joe Shelby and Dr Riley, she perfected the therapy we know today,
                    her family are still training many therapists, and Reflexology its self has
                    bloomed - there are many different reflexology techniques and many reflex
                    treatments, working with specific conditions and systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reflexologists work with the feet and hands to help fine tune your body,
                    allowing all your bodily systems to work in harmony.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The definition of reflexology is: Reflexology is a science that deals with the
                    principle that there are reflex areas in the feet and hands that correspond to
                    all the glands, organs and parts of the body. Reflexology is a unique method of
                    using the thumbs and fingers on these reflex areas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reflexology relieves stress and tension, improves blood supply and promotes the
                    unblocking of nerve impulses and helps achieve homoeostasis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stress and tension is linked to an alarming amount of everyday conditions which
                    will bring the body out of balance and in order to keep the body operating at
                    peak perfection reflexologists unblock anything in the way to allow for the
                    blood to reach every gland and organ, fixing any short circuits in the nerve
                    system affected by stresses and tensions, allowing relaxation, improving blood
                    flow and bring more oxygen-rich blood to every inch of your body - Homoeostasis
                    is reached.
                </p>

                <img
                    src="./img/logo_IIR.jpg"
                    class="iir-logo clearfix"
                    alt="The logo for the Internationa Institute of Reflexology"
                />

                <p>
                    Reflexology could help treat a never ending list of conditions from stress and
                    tension to insomnia, morning sickness to carpal tunnel syndrome, joint problems
                    to drug addiction... Or you can just take some time out for you!
                </p>

                <p>
                    It really is a science and it really does work. It could help a never ending
                    list of conditions, even if you are fit and healthy something like reflexology
                    is good to do just because of how beneficial it is for your body.
