                    <p>
                        My name is Rachael and I am a qualified Reflexologist. I am trained in foot
                        and hand reflexology and was trained by and a part of the International
                        Institute of Reflexology using the original “Ingham Method”, created by our
                        very own Eunice D. Ingham.
                    </p>

                    <img
                        src="./img/rachael.jpg"
                        class="about--image clearfix"
                        alt="A picture of Rachael, reflexologist"
                    />

                    <p>
                        I first found reflexology after travelling through Asia. I went there to try
                        to find answers to my problems - I had been through a lot of heart ache and
                        I needed to see if there was any point in life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout my time in Asia I started understanding the art of energy work
                        and eventually started to really feel a connection with my surroundings.
                        Something inside me wanted to do more for others - to give back in some way
                        - any way I could help others get through hard times, as I have. I knew
                        using this new found love for energy work had a part to play.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When returning from my amazing adventure I wasn't sure what path to take. I
                        enjoyed massage and researched different massage methods however I was also
                        very interested in the traditional Chinese methods. So after some research I
                        discovered Reflexology. The bright colours on the foot and hand charts and
                        the clever way the whole body was mapped out of the feet and hands intrigued
                        me. I
                        <i>had</i> to know more!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After a long year of hard work, dedication and a few tears, I got my
                        qualification! And thanks to my course I became focused and ready to pass on
                        the knowledge and the skill of reflexology. I feel everyone should try it!
                        Helping others to feel happier and more positive is very special and
                        rewarding.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I aim to take Reflexology to as many places as possible. I aim to do and
                        have done: Coffee mornings, one-to-one treatments, retreats, festivals, hen
                        and stag do's... and anywhere the client and I feel will be beneficial for
                        them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I will bring my energy and love of Reflexology to your life. I am here to
                        help. Thank you for visiting my website, I hope we cross paths sometime
                        soon.
                    </p>

                        Love, Peace & Happiness,
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is Reflexology?</h3>

                    <p>
                        The basis of Reflexology has been recorded throughout history, going as far
                        back as the time of the ancient Egyptians. The practise was passed through
                        many doctors and was finally developed by the late, great Eunice Ingham.
                        With the support of Dr. Joe Shelby and Dr Riley, she perfected the therapy
                        we know today, her family are still training many therapists, and
                        Reflexology its self has bloomed - there are many different reflexology
                        techniques and many reflex treatments, working with specific conditions and
                        systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Reflexologists work with the feet and hands to help fine tune your body,
                        allowing all your bodily systems to work in harmony.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The definition of reflexology is: Reflexology is a science that deals with
                        the principle that there are reflex areas in the feet and hands that
                        correspond to all the glands, organs and parts of the body. Reflexology is a
                        unique method of using the thumbs and fingers on these reflex areas.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Reflexology relieves stress and tension, improves blood supply and promotes
                        the unblocking of nerve impulses and helps achieve homoeostasis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Stress and tension is linked to an alarming amount of everyday conditions
                        which will bring the body out of balance and in order to keep the body
                        operating at peak perfection reflexologists unblock anything in the way to
                        allow for the blood to reach every gland and organ, fixing any short
                        circuits in the nerve system affected by stresses and tensions, allowing
                        relaxation, improving blood flow and bring more oxygen-rich blood to every
                        inch of your body - Homoeostasis is reached.
                    </p>

                        src="./img/logo_IIR.jpg"
                        class="iir-logo clearfix"
                        alt="The logo for the Internationa Institute of Reflexology"
                    />

                    <p>
                        Reflexology could help support a never ending list of conditions: from
                        stress and tension to insomnia; morning sickness to carpal tunnel syndrome;
                        joint problems to drug addiction... Or you can just take some time out for
                        you!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It really is a science and it really does work. It could help a never ending
                        list of conditions, even if you are fit and healthy something like
                        reflexology is good to do just because of how beneficial it is for your
                        body.
